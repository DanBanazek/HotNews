Hot News
==============
This is a site I developed as a way to learn Code First development with MVC 4  and to increase worker efficiency at my company.
At its heart it is a simple Blogging Application that allows users to register and make news posts.
It currently uses the LocalDB engine included in VS2012 and the SimpleMemberShipAuthorization that is included in a default MVC 4 project.

As of the initial commit, I have created all of the CRUD functionality for all of the models (Post,Category,User,Product) and instantiated Login/ Registration.
I plan on using this as my scratch application for all things MVC and javascript. So it will be changing and updating frequently.
